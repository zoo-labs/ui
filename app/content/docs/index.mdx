description: Beautifully designed components that you can copy and paste into your apps. Accessible. Customizable. Open Source.

Hanzo UI is a comprehensive component library available in two ways:

1. **NPM Package**: Install `@hanzo/ui` as a dependency for instant access to all components
2. **Copy & Paste**: Use our CLI to add individual components to your project with full customization

**Why offer both approaches?**

The npm package provides convenience and automatic updates, while the CLI approach gives you complete ownership and control over the code. Choose what works best for your project.

_Build your applications faster with battle-tested, accessible components._

## FAQ

		Why copy/paste and not packaged as a dependency?
	</AccordionTrigger>
	<AccordionContent>
The idea behind this is to give you ownership and control over the code, allowing you to decide how the components are built and styled.

Start with some sensible defaults, then customize the components to your needs.

One of the drawback of packaging the components in an npm package is that the style is coupled with the implementation. _The design of your components should be separate from their implementation._
